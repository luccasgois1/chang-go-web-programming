# Applications of Chang Go Web Programming

This repository is a group of applicaitons that were build based on the examples of the book:
[Go Web Programming - Sau Sheong Chang](https://www.manning.com/books/go-web-programming)

All the original source code, presented on the book is available on: https://github.com/sausheong/gwp.

But this repo here has my personal touch in some details.
